# Potential confounding variable: Urbanization.
# Justification: A country's urbanization level may cause changes in corruption
# levels and be correlated with political participation and literacy rates. Life
# in a more densely populated area can facilitate a more active role of civil
# society in politics and help citizens fight corruption. City life can also
# make political participation more likely and boost literacy rates by making
# societies more likely to establish labor unions, universities, and a free
# press.
