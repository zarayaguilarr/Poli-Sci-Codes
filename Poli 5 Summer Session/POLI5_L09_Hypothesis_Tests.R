# From the original QoG cross-section codebook: "In the QoG Basic CS dataset,
# data from and around 2017 is included. Data from 2017 is prioritized, however,
# if no data is available for a country for 2017, data for 2018 is included. If
# no data exists for 2018, data for 2016 is included, and so on up to a maximum
# of +/- 3 years."

# We will assume that QoG data is a representative sample of countries.
